## DESCRIPTION

The ironSource Ad SDK enables developers to monetize their apps by integrating various ad formats like rewarded video, interstitials, banners, and offerwall. The SDK supports both iOS and Android platforms and includes features for ad serving, targeting, tracking, and analytics. By leveraging the ironSource Ad SDK, developers can generate revenue from their apps, improve user engagement, and gain insights into user behavior.

## FEATURES 

* Interstitial Ads: Full-screen ads that cover the interface of an app. They're typically displayed at natural transition points in the flow of an app, such as between activities or during the pause between levels in a game.

* Rewarded Video Ads: These are ads that users can choose to watch in exchange for in-app rewards. For example, in a game, users might watch a rewarded video ad to receive extra lives or in-game currency.

* Banner Ads: These are rectangular ads that appear at the top or bottom of an app's screen. They can be a constant presence within an app or appear and disappear at appropriate times.

* Offerwall Ads: These are ads that appear as a list of offers that users can complete in exchange for in-game rewards. Examples of offers might include watching a video, signing up for a trial, or installing another app.

* Mediation Platform: ironSource provides a mediation platform that allows developers to manage multiple ad networks from one place, optimizing fill rates and revenue.
